# Homework 4: Hunting Game in the '90s

> TODO: Consider two-player 3x4 connect-3. Under the "number of pieces on the board" tier definition, figure out the tier with the largest number of positions. After we do that, have them solve 3x4 connect-3 using a hashmap with only enough memory to store the largest and second largest tiers at once. They will need to evict tiers from memory when they're no longer necessary to solve further tiers for it to be possible.
>
> We will need to provide a great skeleton, an easy database persistance API, and the hashmap implementation with limited memory. But this will teach tier-solving very well.
