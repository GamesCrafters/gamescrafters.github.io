# Homework 5: Isomorphic Compression

> TODO: Have them code a solution to 3x3 by 3 Tic-Tac-Toe and a translator function that uses the solution set they generate to turn each record into the equivalent record in the solution of the following game:

Write the numbers from 1 to 9 on a piece of paper. Two players take turns marking the numbers one at a time; for example, the first player could draw circles around his/her numbers, and the second player could draw squares. The game ends when one of the players has, among his/her marked numbers, a subset of size exactly three that sums to 15.
