# Homework 2: Limbing and Bucking 

> TODO: Go through symmetry removal and memoization, techniques which fold a (potentially infinite) game tree into a finite game graph. Have them (try to) prove the correctness of these techniques. Go through why this complicates attributes like WinBy. Have them implement these techniques for N to 0 by S (remove turn bit through symmetry, memoize solving results).
