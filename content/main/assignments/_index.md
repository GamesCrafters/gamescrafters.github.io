# Overview of Assignments

---

1. The first three assignments involve the implementation of three games within a Python-based system for which we provide significant resources, `GamesmanNewbie`. They are an introduction to the most important techniques we use.
2. The fourth assignment is written, and covers partitioning, parallel solving, and other elements that are impractical to leave to implementation.
3. The fifth and sixth assignments are a group project. The fifth is a project specification, and the sixth is a presentation. Please see the [course outline](/) for how this plays out chronologically.
