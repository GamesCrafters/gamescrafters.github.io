# Assignment 4: Theoretical Potpourri

Due date: 10/02/2024

---

**Task:** Answer the following questions.

1. For the following game, write two algorithms in pseudocode that take a game state as input and output a number, effectively partitioning the space of states. Make sure that one of the algorithms induces a meta-graph that is a DAG, and the other a linked list. [...]
2. For the following game, write the tightest possible upper bound on its number of states, and estimate an average number of possible moves for any state. Provide a justification. [...]
3. In the worst case, can a weak solution take as much space as a strong solution to a game? Explain why.
5. Provide an example of a game in reduced graph form with regular states, 2 pure-draw levels, and at least one non-pure draw cluster.
6. [...]

**Provided:**

* Perhaps a {{< katex >}} \LaTeX {{< /katex >}} template for the deranged.

**Metrics:** Nothing, really. Just good effort.

**Learning objectives:** Reinforce and confirm the theoretical knowledge covered during the first third of the semester (see [course roadmap](/)).
